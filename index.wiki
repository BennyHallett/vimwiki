== Focus ==

The number of things I work on concurrently needs to be reduced to around 4.
These should include [[family|Family]], [[health|Health]], [[professional_development|Professional Development]],
and [[sideproject|Side Project]]

These categories will more than likely have several things in each, but the
point is to only focus on one thing from each.

_Current_

* Do things
* Eat good and play football
* Newcastle Ruby
* Git Updated

== Projects ==

* [[newcastle_ruby|Newcastle Ruby]]

== Vim ==

* [[Customisations]]

== Ideas ==

* [[Super Jump Arena]]
